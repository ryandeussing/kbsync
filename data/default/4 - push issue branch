⚡  push your issue branch

// It's good practice to push your branch to origin when you make commits. This way you can share the
// up-to-date branch if you ever need to, and you also have a backup of your work on origin that is
// as recent as your last push.

$[issue-branch] git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph // confirm that you have commits to push

☝️  espanso trigger: `:log`

⚠️  if you don't have commits, you probably don't want to push

$[issue-branch] git push // if this returns an error, follow the instructions

$[issue-branch] git push --set-upstream origin issue-branch // only necessary the first time you push

☝️  git will show you this command when you try to push a branch for the first time
