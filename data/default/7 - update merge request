⚡  update a merge request

// there are two ways to update an MR - in the GitLab UI or locally

## update the branch in GitLab's merge request UI

when you get code suggestions on the MR, you can apply them

☝️  add multiple suggestions to a batch so they result in one commit

## update the branch locally

when you need to add or modify changes on your branch with an open MR, make a commit locally

⚠️  don't use the GitLab UI - among other complications, it creates a commit for every changed file

$[issue-branch] git pull // make sure you have integrated any changes that have been added to the MR

$[issue-branch] git status // confirm the files you have changed locally

$[issue-branch] git add {path/to/file} // stage changed files individually (or)
$[issue-branch] git add -A // stage all the files with changes

☝️  espanso trigger: `:add`

$[issue-branch] git commit -m '{your commit message}' // ⚠️  not 'git commit --amend'

☝️  add new changes to a single new commit

$[issue-branch] git push
    - when you push additional commits to an MR they will be squashed on merge
    
⚠️  don't use git `commit --amend` when you have an active merge request! 
⚠️  don't rebase your branch in the GitLab merge request MR! (that will happen at merge time)
