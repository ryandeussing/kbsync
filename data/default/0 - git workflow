⚡ git workflow

// this is a highly condensed version of https://docs.engineering.redhat.com/display/HCCDOC/HCCDOC+Git+workflow
// the workflow steps below are displayed in the sequence a new contributor might use them, from cloning a repository
// to making their first merge request -experienced contributors can also use this guide as a reference without
// following the content sequentially.

## clone the repo

- see `kb 1`

## create an issue branch

- branch name = Jira issue key
- see `kb 2`

## make an empty initial commit on your issue branch

- this prevents amending someone else's commit
- see `kb 2`

## work + preview your changes in your editor (VSCode, Atom, etc)

- lean on VSCode preview - it's the fastest way to see your Asciidoc changes in HTML

## commit changes on your issue branch `kb 3`

- view the commit log to confirm the last commit is yours
- aim for a single commit via 'git commit --amend`
- replace your empty initial commit with our template
  - espanso trigger = ':commit'
- see `kb 3`

## push your issue branch to origin for backup and to make work visible

- view the commit log to confirm the commit you are pushing
- see `kb 4`

## rebase your issue branch regularly (before you have a merge request)

- this keeps it synched with origin main
- see `kb 5`

## create a merge request (when you think the work is ready to be merged)

- mark it draft
- apply the preflighted label
- note: when your branch has an open MR
  - ⚠️ do not 'git commit --amend'
  - ⚠️ do not rebase (don't rebase locally, don't click the rebase button on the MR)
  - ⚠️ do not force push
- see `kb 6`

## update your merge request by applying suggestions in GitLab

- apply them as a batch to minimize additional commits
- additional commit(s) will be squashed on merge
- see `kb 7`

## update your merge request with a new commit from your local issue branch

- 'git pull' the issue branch before making any changes // in case new commits exist on the MR
- aim for a single commit with any new changes
- ⚠️ do not amend, do not rebase, do not force push
- additional commit(s) will be squashed on merge
- see `kb 7`

## mark your MR as ready

- the MR will be merged
- see `kb 8`
