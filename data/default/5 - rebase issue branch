⚡ rebase issue branch onto main

// To catch merge conflicts that might otherwise delay your MR, you should rebase your issue branch. Rebasing your issue
// branch keeps it up-to-date with changes that have been merged to origin main since you created your issue branch,
// or since the last time you rebased it.

$[main] git pull // synchronize your 'main' with any remote changes from `origin main` - no changes = no need to rebase!

$[main] git switch issue-id // switch/checkout the issue branch you want to rebase

$[issue-branch] git status // make sure you have no uncommited changes on your issue branch - see `kb 3` if you do

$[issue-branch] git rebase origin/main // add changes you just pulled from `origin main` to your issue branch

☝️ does the commit log make sense? espanso trigger: `:log`

$[issue-branch] git push -f // force push required any time you've rebased a branch

⚠️ don't rebase and don't force push when you have an open MR!
