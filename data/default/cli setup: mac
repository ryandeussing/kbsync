⚡ cli setup (mac)

the following tools and configurations are for you to consider using as a baseline - it's split into a macOS section and a Linux section.

## Tool #1 - iTerm2

Iterm2 - download at `iterm2.com` - is a better Unix terminal emulator tham the one that ships with macOS. It's an app, you download it and simply run it instead of Terminal.app

## Tool #2 - ohmyzsh

`zsh` is an optional, extensible replacement for the default `bash` shell, and ohmyz.sh is a tool that makes `zsh` configuration easy via themes.

to install ohmyzsh, run the installation script found at `ohmyz.sh/#install` from the command line and then restart your terminal.

## agnosto theme

you can choose any ohmyzsh theme, but a good starting point is `agnosto` - to install and configure it:

1. open `.zshrc` (your ohmyzsh configuration file)

$ code ~/.zshrc

☝️  note: `code` is the default alias for Visual Studio Code

1. in your `.zshrc`, assign the ZSH_THEME variable by adding this line: 

`ZSH_THEME="agnoster"` 

2. save your `.zshrc` file and then source it

$ source ~/.zshrc

now you'll see the theme in iTerm2, but the fonts and colors will probably look a bit off - let's fix that

4. install the Powerline fonts (for displaying symbols on the command line)

$ git clone git@github.com:powerline/fonts.git
$ cd fonts
$ ./install.sh
$ cd ..
$ rm -rf fonts

5. select `Go Mono for Powerline` as the "Non-ASII font" in your terminal or terminal emulator settings

now your fonts should look great, but the colors will need some tweaking

6. download this Color Preset file: `raw.githubusercontent.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes/master/schemes/Solarized%20Dark%20-%20Patched.itermcolors` (the filename will be "Solarized Dark - Patched.itermcolors")

7. import and apply the above Color Preset file into iTerm2:

- open the iTerm2 preferences
- find the 'Color Presets' dropdown at 'Profiles > Colors'
- in the 'Color Presets' dropdown, select 'Import ...'
- select 'Solarized Dark - Patched.itermcolors' from wherever you saved it
- after importing, make sure the 'Solarized Dark' Color Preset is selected

8. make a couple adjustments to your `.zshrc` file

- add the line `DEFAULT_USER=$(whoami)` to remove the default, clunky prefix from your shell prompt

☝️  note: it's a good idea to add a comment next to each function or variable you add to your `.zshrc` so in future you'll have some idea what you were thinking when you made each change
