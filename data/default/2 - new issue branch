⚡  create an issue branch

// Doc requirements reside in Jira. When you're ready to work on a Jira issue, you should create an issue branch
// on your local clone of the repository. You should also add an empty commit to it, to safeguard against accidentally
// amending the wrong commit later.

$[main] git pull // confirm you are on 'main'; pull changes

$[main] git switch -c <issue-id> // create a new branch named for an issue, e.g. RHINDOC-123

$[issue-branch] git commit --allow-empty -m 'empty initial commit' // on issue branch, make an empty commit you will amend

☝️  espanso trigger: `:gce`
