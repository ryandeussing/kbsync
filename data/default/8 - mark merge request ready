⚡  mark a merge request ready - and trigger publishing

when your MR should be merged, you can mark it ready in GitLab UI.

☝️  it's the author's responsibility to mark their MR as ready

marking a merge request ready signifies that:

- the reviews are complete
- the comment threads are resolved
- the commits are mergeable
- the changes are to be published (unless the merge request is labeled hold)

when you mark a merge request ready:

- the Draft: prepending is automatically removed
- the assigned maintainer is notified
- the commit is added to the merge queue

when you @-mention the DPM (or whomever publishes the docs) in a comment, they get an alert to merge and publish the changes.
